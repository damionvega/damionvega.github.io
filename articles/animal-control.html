a walk</p>
<h1>Synopsis</h1><h2>Showed up at the office, signed a release form.</h2><p>Was introduced to Jennifer and sat with her for about 20 mins while she did
some paperwork then we went to the truck. I asked her what I should do incase
of a conflict (she gets attacked by a dog or something). She said that she
would let me know if she thought something might go wrong and to just stay in
the truck. But I should not help her, but just come back to the truck and call
for help on the radio.</p>
<p>Officers are given a list of locations to stop by during the day and are given
additional calls throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Call 1</h2><p>Went to Evergreen for a barking dog call (had camouflage decorated on the fence,
sign that said the property was under surveillance)</p>
<h2>stopped by a police station? to pick up ?</h2><h2>Call 2</h2><p>went to issue a warning for a letter that came back to the office marked as
wrong address. It turned out that it was in fact the wrong address and also
the wrong name.</p>
<p>Officer Dow also wanted to check in on a guy who lets his dogs run wild
(except for when animal control is in town). No sign of the &quot;two brown dogs&quot;.</p></article></div><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
