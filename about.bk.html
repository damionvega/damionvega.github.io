all you need is a little capital to get it past a simple prototype mockup

and those people are humans; not 'things' for you to gamble

business.<br><br>Let me start from the beginning...</p><div class="blur"></div></div></article><article class="three md12"><div class="md6 left pad"><h2>The sixty mile hike</h2><p class="bg clearfix">My friend Scott and I had gone on a sixty mile hike back home after
he had gotten into an argument with his girlfriend during a camping
trip with her family. I started packing my bag with him and he asked,
"You're walking back with me?" I replied with a stern look, "Yeah--what
else am I going to do, hang out with your girlfriend and her family? Let's
get out of here."<br><br>This is a story for another time. The short version is: we walked and
talked about all of the dreams we wanted to achieve in our lives for
eight miles and a tow truck driver pulled over and asked "Where
you boys headed?" luckily, he was taking a load to Sacramento where
we lived at the time. We hopped in.<br><br>The discussion in the portion we actually did end up walking was a turning
point in both of our lives and we came to the conclusion that motorcycles
are fun and all, but we didn't want to build with our hands anymore,
but our minds. Everything starts with an idea.</p></div><div class="md6 right"><h2>The big idea</h2><p class="bg clearfix">The concept was a platform where you would be able to trade apps with
others: if you had a $20 app you could trade straight across with another
person who had an app of the same value, if the person's app was
less valuable, you would be credited the difference for future trade.
In retrospect, we were planning the Napster for apps without knowing it.
Scott asked me "How are we going to do this?"<br><br>We didn't have the money to hire a developer to build it for us,
neither of us had CS degrees or any real programming experience, and
we didn't have friends in the industry to help us. So I replied with the
only option we really had at the time: "I can probably make it, I
have Dreamweaver on my computer." How na&iuml;ve.<br><br>I was kind of a computer nerd in my middle school to early high school
years when I wasn't on my skateboard. Playing Counter-Strike, installing
mods &amp; skins into their proper directories and playing around with my MySpace&nbsp;<code>img</code>&nbsp;tags and hex colors was easy enough, "I can figure it out"
I thought to myself. If you google image search&nbsp;<code>motorcycle wiring diagram</code>&nbsp;, this was what I was comparing it to at the time. Just another thing
I had no idea about to learn without a proper teacher.<br><br>During this time there wasn't the same programming education there
is today. I had a really hard time figuring out what you needed to even
build a static page, let alone a trading application.
After reading countless blogs and Stack Overflow answers, I was able
to produce landing pages in HTML &amp; CSS relatively easily with all
of the tricks I've learned. But how do we make these interactive?
JavaScript? Is that like this PHP thing? Oh it's Java, no? What's
a localhost? Command Line? You mean that black interface with
the green text Jason Bourne uses? You have to be some kind of genius
to use that though, don't you?</p></div></article><article class="four clearfix"><div class="md6 left pad clearfix"><h2>Discovery</h2><p class="bg clearfix">After spending a year with my face attached to my computer screen, I eventually
learned all of these basic fundamentals to build both Scott and I websites as
well as our dream company website, a creative thinktank we called DNSD Global
Ventures. Under this name housed our army of ideas we talked about during the
course of the year: Map The Move, Tennup, AutoGenius, First Date Genius, and
Gifts of Treasure to name a few.<br><br>We had an ongoing joke, "Wanna drive to Silicon Valley? Right now?" Which
we figured was the only solution to get one of these ideas off the ground and
come to fruition (yep, we were one of<em>&nbsp;those guys</em>). We came to an
agreement that if one of us said it again that we would pack our bikes into
the back of the truck and start driving. That day inevitably came not long thereafter.</p></div><div class="md6 right"><h2>Adventure</h2><div class="bg clearfix"><p>I planned our trip itinerary from Denver through Salt Lake City, Reno
then Sacramento which consisted of:</p><ul class="checklist"><li>1,279 miles</li><li>one truck</li><li>two motorcycles</li><li>four bags of clothes</li><li>two pairs of sunglasses</li><li>one guitar</li><li>one welder</li><li>tools</li><li>not nearly enough money to cover the trip.</li></ul><p>Perfect. This is what everyone does, right?</p><p class="tiny">I found the answer to this later when I asked our friend Jake the
same question after we rode trash cans down a hill in San Francisco
with him. "No," he laughed, "no one does that."</p><p>We drove through the night and the trip had begun. I had faith the truck would
make it--after all, it had more balls than the Broncos' locker room, could
take a side swipe from a smart car no problem, had no power steering
and a granny four on the floor. Add a little<span class="motorhead">&nbsp;Mot&ouml;rhead</span>&nbsp;at full volume and you've got yourself a machine built for the
road (yes, none of these are deciding factors when embarking on a trip
half way across the country, but I had you going, didn't I?)<br><br>We eventually arrived to Salt Lake City where we were invited to stay
at Scott's ex-girlfriend's friend's place. Ironically,
this friend would slowly turn into my girlfriend sometime during the
trip. While we were exiting off of the highway I noticed the truck
lost some power, but we decided to fix it the next day and get some
much needed sleep.</p></div></div></article><article class="five clearfix"><h2>It happens</h2><div class="bg clearfix"><p class="md6 left">After some quick tinkering the next day, we were on our way west again.
We got on the highway and drove approximately thirty miles, then suddenly, smoke
came barreling out of the hood. From a distance it probably looked like a truck on
fire with two motocycles driving it. This couldn't be good. We let the smoke settle
and I tried starting it. Nothing. Turned the key again with a couple taps of the gas.
Nothing. The first thing we noticed after checking the levels was we were dangerously
low on oil and the coolant was nonexistant.<br><br>The only oil we had was in one of our bikes and we had to put it in
the truck. We jerry-rigged a 'solution' for the coolant with two permanent
markers blocking the coolant line to the reservoir and to go one direction:
into the motor. We decided to try to get back to a little gas station
we stopped at ten miles back to get some oil and find a better fix for the coolant.<br><br>After what seemed like hours, the truck still wasn't starting and
there was really only one option: Dreamweaver. Just kidding, there was
a small decline behind us and I said, "If we push the truck down
that way, I can jump in and try to start it by popping the clutch."
This was a long shot, we would be lucky to get the truck going fifteen
miles per hour down this dinky little downgrade and were going to be
in an even worse situation if it didn't work considering we wouldn't
be visible from the highway anymore, but we had to try.</p><p class="md6 left">We rolled the truck back, turned it around and looked at each other. We took a
deep breath, gave each other a nod and began pushing the big hunk of metal down the
slope like a pair of ameteur bobsledders at their first Olympic Games
tryout. I jumped in and pushed the clutch in and with my lips tucked
into my mouth and brows pushed tight, I snapped the clutch and slammed
the gas. Nothing. "SHIT!" I exclaimed, "Keep pushing!" I pushed the
clutch again and spoke with the truck, "C'mon LaFonda, you can do it."
We were almost to the bottom of the downgrade, it was now or never. I
popped the clutch and slammed the gas again and this time the motor
roared! Scott jumped in the window and we yelled with excitement with
our fists out the windows, "YEEEAAHHHHHHHH FUCK YEAH!!!!"<br><br>In my state of superhuman euphoria, I had a Lieutenant Dan moment and
screamed at the sky while seeing red, "IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?!" We
were super hyped and continued down this windy dirt road hoping that
it eventually hooked back to the highway. It did and we broke down five
miles later on the highway. Either that wasn't all 'he' had, or that
oil from the bike didn't last very long.</p></div></article><article class="six clearfix"><div class="md6 left pad"><h2>Plan B</h2><div class="bg clearfix"><p>Someone pulled over and towed us to the gas station and while I was somewhat elated
to get off the side of the highway, I had to ask our Salt Lake City hosts for another
night. After getting the OK, we somehow got back to their house and one night turned
into a week and a half and a pissed off roomate- we had to get out of there and
tried to get to Reno four separate times, but the truck was not cooperating.</p><p>We later found out that the guy who sold us the truck had the wrong radiator in the
truck, it was meant for a v6, not a v8 and thus, not cooling the motor
properly and burning oil excessively. We decided to sell everything
we had and fly to San Jose.</p></div></div><blockquote class="bg md6 right"><p>"Desire. The starting point of all achievement. The first step toward riches.<br><br>Every person who wins in an undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut
all sources of retreat. Only by so doing, can one be sure of maintaining that
state of mind known as a 'burning desire to win', essential to success.<br><br>Every human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose
of money wishes for it. Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring
riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning
definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with
persistence which does not recognize failure, will bring riches."</p><h6>- Napoleon Hill</h6></blockquote><h2 class="clearfix">Land of Tech</h2><div class="bg clearfix"><p class="md6 left pad">We landed in San Jose and took a shuttle to the CalTran where we ran
into a developer who was visiting a friend. I thought, "This is
great, we've been here twenty minutes and are already running into
people to talk to." We later booked a stay at a 'Hacker Mansion'
via Airbnb--this should be awesome. We envisioned a house with whiteboards for walls
and ideas bouncing off of these whiteboards, but it ended up being a house
full of twenty-something-year-old kids drooling about how great it was
to see Mark Zuckerberg speak at Startup School and all of the other
tech celebrities they saw.</p><p class="md6 left">There were some smart minds in that house, but we realized this wasn't
the creative outlet we were looking for and decided to pay a visit to our
buddy Jake in San Francisco after submitting our Y Combinator application.
Before writing this (April 8, 2014), I took a look at the designs we
had at the time and laughed. Even if we happened to get in front of
an investor, I'm sure they would've thought "Hopefully
these guys are better leaders than web designers, because this&mldr; looks
like it was made with Play-Doh." Let's just say: we didn't get a call back.</p></div></article><article class="seven clearfix"><h2>Fast-forward another year and a half</h2><div class="bg clearfix"><p class="md6 left">Since our Bay Area visit, I've been busy doing actual web work
and a ton of reading. Web design &amp; development has taught me a lot,
and ultimately brought to my realization that I really enjoy the user experience
aspect of web development.<br><br>I've freelanced for peanuts, helped turn around a non-profit and joined a health
startup until the sweat equity and eighty hour workweeks started affecting my client
work. I've come to understand the workflow, roles and importance of a team, the
psychology of proper layout, the art of typography, how internet marketing,
social media marketing, and SEO works, how to ship--not perfect, how
open source is changing the way products that may have never been built
become a complete success, that JavaScript is not Java's sister,
and that AJAX is definitely not some guy with cool nickname--who would've known?</p><p class="md6 left">It's been difficult without a mentor, yet fun relentlessly learning
everything from front to back end to the things I'm focused on
now: fullstack JS and continuing business research.<br><br>The future of JS and the web as a whole is bright. I'm working every
day towards mastery with the meaningful projects with the people I meet.
I'm looking forward to these next couple of years to see where this
road of the internet takes me. With the ships burned and the motivation
to keep learning and build awesome things, I feel this story has just begun.</p></div><p class="bg clearfix thank-you">If you've ever spoken at a conference or created
