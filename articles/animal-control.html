a walk. One morning I encountered an animal control officer. She told
me there was an aggressive dog down the street and advised me to take the side
path. It occured to me I didn&#39;t know what an animal control officer actually
did, so I informed her that I&#39;m taking an journey into the world of
writing and asked if I could interview her. &quot;Well, not right now,&quot; she replied.
She gave me a business card and told me &quot;call that number and they can likely
help you out.&quot; A couple weeks later I was invited for a ride-along with an animal
control officer.</p>
<h1>Synopsis</h1><p>I showed up at the office and signed a release form. Afterwards I was introduced
to Jennifer (Officer Dow). I rode with Officer Dow from nine a.m. to four p.m. During
this time she informed me about everything from the daily interactions of an
animal control officer to strange and disgusting stories, as well as her life
experience while we went on her assigned calls. Towards the end of the day, she
had a call to check up on a hedgehog and a paralyzed goat to ensure they were
being fed and given water–it may sound boring, but the animal owner was sure to
give an interesting take on human perspective and an entertaining end to the day.</p>
<h1>Animal Control: the Officer</h1><p>An animal control officer is typically taking calls on that neighbor whose dog
incessantly barks throughout the day and loose dogs wandering. These are all
called in–animal control officers aren&#39;t the evil &quot;dog catchers&quot; we take them
for, in fact most of them love animals as much as humans. Other calls in the
Colorado foothills are for loose horses, emus, and even bisons. In the summer,
bats are a common animal they need to catch and be let back into its natural
habitat, as well as skunks.</p>
<p>When someone decides they want to be an animal control officer they&#39;re likely
a person who loves and cares for animals, this is the greatest commonality among
everyone I spoke with at the Jefferson County Animal Control office (all of the
current officers, other than one, have all worked with the County for more than
15 years); there aren&#39;t a lot of jobs you can gain a decent salary to spend time
with animals, and this is a respectable, yet not an easy one to do so.</p>
<p>Other than that, law enforcement experience, someone who is not afraid of
people, as there may be people an office may need to deal with (people who seem
&quot;off&quot;, or hoarders, who may be very defensive, and others who can be violent),
has a tolerance for gross things (dead animals, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how many bags
you put a dead skunk in that has recently sprayed,&quot; Dow says.) I asked Dow what
a skunk&#39;s spray was like, &quot;is it a squirt bottle mist or is it more like
a super-soaker stream?&quot; She replied, &quot;It&#39;s kind of a mist. And it&#39;s &#39;yellowy&#39;.&quot;
She told me if you get sprayed, prepare to have everything smelling like it,
there&#39;s no getting the smell out. Your car will smell like it, your shower
towels will smell like it–OK, let&#39;s move on to the hiring process.</p>
<h2>Recruitment</h2><p>All applicants need to undergo a six-month process in which they are given
a series of tests and exams. The process is of the following, passing each
advances you to the next:</p>
<h3>A Wonderlic exam</h3><p>This is a test measuring general cognitive ability in the areas of math,
vocabulary, and reasoning. Used to gauge an applicant&#39;s job potential,
educational potential, and training potential. A sample question would be:
When a rope is selling twenty cents per two feet, how many feet can you buy for
thirty dollars?)</p>
<h3>Oral board interview</h3><p>Based on the Wonderlic exam, candidates are selected to come into the office
for a face-to-face interview to see how they might fit with the team.</p>
<h3>Skill assessment</h3><p>The skill assessment is where the candidate has their chance to show they have
what it takes to work in the field. They are given role-playing scenarios and
then taken to a nearby animal shelter where they are given the task of
identifying ten breeds of dogs which are picked ahead of time. Two of the dogs
are then taken out to a yard where the candidate is then given the task to catch
the dogs and load one of them into the truck. The container the dog is put into
while being transported is four feet off of the ground, so the candidate needs
to figure out if they can get the dog into the container by luring it with a
treat or if the ramp is needed.</p>
<h3>Job offer</h3><p>If the candidate has made it this far and is likely to get along with the team,
they are given a job offer after they have passed a background check and series
of exams: a psych exam, a physical exam, and a polygraph test.</p>
<p>After asking what the polygraph was used for, Officer Dow replied, &quot;Before they go
to the interview they have to do a polygraph test. They want to make sure you
have been truthful in your interview and there are certain things they look for
such as have smoked marijuana in the past X years or if you stole something and
weren&#39;t truthful. So it&#39;s important to be truthful in your interview, because if
you answer differently during the polygraph then you likely won&#39;t get the job.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h1>Riding along</h1><p>I showed up to the Jefferson County Animal Control Office and after filling out
a release form, was introduced to Officer Jennifer Dow. I sat in the office
while the officers did their morning paperwork. In the office were a total of
seven women: two women in the front who took care of incoming phone calls and
greeted anyone who came into the office, three animal control officers, one
supervisor, and the department chief.</p>
<p>Before loading into the truck. I asked if I could have Dow wear a microphone for
the duration of the ride but the supervisor, Officer Christine &quot;Chris&quot; Padilla
declined. I was allowed to record parts of our conversation but she didn&#39;t like
the idea of Dow wearing a mic while in the field, so I sufficed for a microphone
in the cupholder of the truck.</p>
<p>The truck an officer drives is a Ford F250 fitted with four containers to hold animals
in the back. Inside is a computer for the officer to input reports, keep logs,
and refer to the GPS map as they went on their calls and a radio which received
county-wide transmissions from animal control and the police throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Background</h2><p>Dow is originally from Massachusetts (yes, she&#39;s a big fan of lobstah and clam
chowdah.) She graduated from from UMass Amherst with a degree in Animal Science &amp;
Business Management. I&#39;m always interested in hearing how people ended up in
their occupation and often find that people stumble into the thing they do for
a living, when I asked Dow if she knew what she wanted to do or if being an
animal control officer was on the list of occupation possibilities she replied,
&quot;Nope. I didn&#39;t have a clue.&quot;</p>
<p>After she graduated, she got a job with MSPCA Animal Shelter and was &quot;communting
from home and getting paid nothing&quot;. Then she worked for Charles Riverfarm
Services where she worked with animals that were there to be tested for
pharmeceutical companies. She then went in a different direction–perhaps in an
effort to give herself a larger income, or to have a break from animals, it&#39;s
unclear–started working for Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Through Enterprise, she made
a move to Colorado in 1998 after hearing from a friend that she would like it.
She worked at the Enterprise office at a Double Tree Hotel where her future
husband, Todd, worked as the Bell Captain. They flirted for a few months, she
would call him &quot;Short Tie Boy&quot;–his logical-dominant brain brought a lack of
aesthetic detail which was obviously apparent to her and their coworkers. Todd
eventually asked her out and they married September 2001.</p>
<p>Todd worked as an electrician apprentice outside of his hotel hours. Over time
he got his journeyman&#39;s license, then his master&#39;s license. He later landed a job
with the Cherry Creek School District and now works for the state as a contractor.
He also has his own business focused on commercial and residential work for people
like ex-Denver-Bronco Brandon Stokley. Meanwhile, Jennifer Dow started working at
an animal shelter where she worked with Aurora animal control officers. During this
time she had developed a growing interest in becoming an animal control officer
herself, but Aurora had no openings. She decided she would check neighboring
counties and saw Jefferson County was hiring, she applied in 1999 and has been
with the county ever since. Outside of work Dow has earned her real-estate
license and throws jewelry parties for people where she sells jewelry to the
attendees which brings in some extra money for her to pay for her trainer for
the triathalons she competes in to raise money for Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.</p>
<h2>Barking Dog Complaints</h2><p>Our first call was to issue a barking dog warning called in by a neighbor. We
drove on I-70 into the mountains near Evergreen on a beautiful and soon-to-be
hot day. We arrived at a region where there was a sparse collection of houses on
a windy road and parked in front of a driveway with a fence blocking entrance
toward the home&#39;s front door. The fence was covered in camouflage leaves and had
a sign with an image of a security camera warning, &quot;This property is under
surveillance.&quot; &quot;Well at least the pet owner is friendly,&quot; I said to Dow. &quot;Yeah,
no kidding. I&#39;m just going to tape this [the issued warning] to the gate so we
can get out of here.&quot;</p>
<p>Barking dog complaints, horse cruelty, and bats inside people&#39;s homes are the
usual calls that come in to the Jefferson County office. When a neighbor calls in
a barking dog complaint the dog owner is given a warning and 72 hours to rectify
the issue and during this time, Animal Control will not take anymore complaints
regarding the dog. After 72 hours has surpassed, the neighbor can issue another
complaint where Animal Control will ask them: Are they willing to file a complaint?
Are they willing to testify in court? If the neighbor is willing to do both of
these, Animal Control holds on to their complaint and they are informed that a second
neighbor needs to call in with a complaint in order for Animal Control to issue
a summons. If no additional complaint is filed within 6 months, the complaint is
reset. After a summons is issued, the dog owner has a choice of paying a $50 fine
(an admission of guilt) or taking it to court. In either case, the dog owner and
neighbor(s) are sent to mediation in order to work things out.</p>
<h2>Qualify</h2><p>After the first call, Dow had another barking dog complaint to issue and stopped by
a nearby precinct to collect some paperwork. I then learned I came on a good day
because today was &quot;qualify&quot; day. Qualify is the proving of an officer&#39;s tranquilizer
gun competency. An officer has to qualify every quarter.</p>
<p>We drove through the foothills on highway ninety three near a neighborhood where I used
to spend summers as a child. &quot;I used to come up here to my aunts house in the summer
to visit my cousins. They live in a neighborhood over on the other side of Table
Mountain called Apple Meadows, but my cousin called it &#39;Apple Ghettos&#39;.&quot; &quot;Oh
yeah!&quot; She said with familiarity, &quot;That&#39;s what we call it!&quot; before turning off the
highway onto a small road, pulling up behind another officer, Melanie, who was outside
of her truck unlocking the gate to the property. We followed Melanie uphill on the
small road through the pasture to a barn that was painted light blue with an old small
house further up the road the same color &quot;So this is the Jefferson County vacation
house, huh?&quot; I asked. &quot;Yeah, isn&#39;t it nice? You might fall through the floor if
you go in there.&quot; Dow replied. Melanie parked in front of the barn then started
setting up the target and tranquilizer gun while Dow showed me the tools they used
to apprehend dogs and rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>Stacy and Chris showed up a few minutes later and they began to &quot;qualify&quot;. Each
officer takes four practice darts and shoots them at a target about twenty feet
away at a target with marked numbers. These numbers are added up and each
officer is expected to hit a minimum number or else they have to qualify again
the next day. &quot;How often do you find yourself having to use the tranquilizer
gun?&quot; I asked. &quot;I&#39;ve never had to use it.&quot; Dow replied.</p>
<h2>Lunch</h2><p>The ladies took me to lunch with them, a Mexican restaurant they often eat at: La
Carreta. I judge Mexican restaurants primarily on their salsa, and theirs was great.
I decided I would give Dow a break and let her chat with her fellow officers
while I asked the other officers about their job, to which I asked Melanie and
Chris, &quot;Why are you animal control officers?&quot; They both made the same expression
Stacy and Jennifer did when I asked them the same question back at the office
when I arrived: a face of bewilderment with plenty of scanning with the eyes,
looking for an answer as to why they were in the occupation they were in.
I noticed with all of the officers, the answer was the same: they loved animals
(some of them moreso than humans, I don&#39;t blame them.) I told them that
I admired that they were doing something they actually enjoyed. There are so many
stories of people going into careers they&#39;re not interested in because they&#39;re
pressured by their parents or peers and end up mid-life hating themselves for it.</p>
<p>On the way to lunch I asked Dow &quot;So 16 years as an animal control officer. What
keeps you coming back every day?&quot; &quot;You know... I don&#39;t know... [laughs, long
pause] It&#39;s different every day. You&#39;re not sitting there doing the same old
crap, you never know what&#39;s going to happen, and sometimes it&#39;s so stressful
that you want to quit. And sometimes it&#39;s awesome. And I love the people I
work with.&quot; As we were leaving the pasture she referred to the group of people
she works with as &quot;Team Awesome&quot;, and I could definitely tell that the people
she worked with was half the reason why she still worked the job even though
she had extracurricular things she could turn into her full-time gig. She
would miss them, she&#39;s known a lot of them for more than fifteen years. Dow
recalled a time when she wanted to quit and Stacy reminded her, &quot;What other
job do you have so much flexibility, you get to drive around and be in nature,
you don&#39;t have someone breathing down your back all the time, people back you
up when you make certain decisions...&quot; &quot;It&#39;s not so bad of a job,&quot; Dow says,
&quot;but it&#39;s not as easy of a job either. I feel like some people think it&#39;s a
super-easy job. Like, &#39;Oh I&#39;ll just do Animal Control, it will be easy&#39;, and
that&#39;s definitely not the case.&quot;</p>
<h2>Check in on a Goat &amp; Hedgehog</h2><p>After lunch, Padilla wanted us to go to Delta and check in on a family that was
housing a paralyzed goat and hedgehog that was supposed to get a new cage. We had
to drive way into the mountains to the county border into a town called Pine. We
took a road outside of the town onto a windy dirt road where we arrived to the property
on an incline where there was a camper/trailer with a children&#39;s playhouse and tent,
a fenced area behind the trailer with two baby goats and another fenced area a few
meters to the side which contained some chickens, ducks, and turkeys. Basically, your
typical American household. They&#39;d been living here for two months.</p>
<p>Outside the trailer was a tent where I&#39;m guessing someone slept (I later found out
this is where the son sleeps). There was also some kind of Playskool children&#39;s
playhouse that was broken down on the side of the tent. On the other side was the
goat with the paralyzed legs. It was being held in a three foot by three foot cage
and was being shielded from the sun by a some sort of children&#39;s pop-up fabric castle
play tent, I believe it might have been Cinderella themed. Later, I saw the goat&#39;s
water bowl was empty. Dow got out of the truck, walked down the small hill, and
knocked on the trailer door while I stood at the top of the hill by the truck.</p>
<p>Honestly, it wouldn&#39;t have surprised me if the door had flung open and she was blasted
with a shotgun. Instead, a little man opened the door. I say &quot;little man&quot; because
Dow nor myself could figure out if this guy was 17 or 27 because he was small, say
five foot six, had a grown man&#39;s beard, and was covered in dog hair. He was dressed
like he might have been part of a black metal band from Sweden with his black leather
bracelets and pale skin and looked like he just woke up and possibly still strung out
from the weekend partying (it was Tuesday, so obviously this guy parties hard).
We were told that there was a mother, father, and son who lived in the trailer, so
we were guessing this was the son. She told him she was there to check in on a goat
and hedgehog to which he replied, &quot;Yes the goat is right here,&quot; motioning to the
cage next to the door of the trailer as he walked out in his black socks. The goat
&quot;baaa&quot;&#39;d as if it knew Dow was there to save it. &quot;OK, it doesn&#39;t look like it has
any water, is there any water we can give it?&quot; Dow asked. &quot;I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s worked
out with the neighbors [the water situation as they had no running water].&quot; the
little man replied. Dow checked that the hedgehog had water then asked him if he
lived there, if he was the son of the family that lived there, and where the mother
was. He said that he was the father&#39;s brother who was visiting for the weekend and
that he wasn&#39;t sure when anyone would be back. Dow decided she would just write
the mother and father a note and stop by again later that week until the mother
pulled up the road in her 1998-ish forest green Subaru Outback with her son and
shouted, &quot;Can you pull back a little so I pull into the driveway and we can talk?&quot;
She was expecting someone to stop by. Dow jumped in the truck and reversed the truck
so she could pull in.</p>
<p>The small mother got out of the car and was wearing a blue t-shirt three times her
size and wore very straight dyed candy apple green hair under her baseball cap where
her green sunglasses sat. She walked up to Dow and greeted her with a smile and
Dow introduced me as someone who was riding along with her today then the mother
explained what was going on with the goat–unfortunately, the goat was going to
be euthanized later in the day. She then took Dow into the trailer while I stood
outside (I was paranoid of the little rocker man stealing something from the
truck but it turns out he stayed inside the trailer playing a video game with this
face twelve inches from the screen.) Inside, she showed that they got new tanks
for both the hedgehog and the turtle (it turns out there wasn&#39;t only a hedgehog
inside, but a cat, two big dogs, and a turtle as well.) She then took Dow over
to look at the goats as Dow motioned me over. As I walked down the small hill I couldn&#39;t
help but be sad for the paralyzed goat that &quot;baa&quot;&#39;d at me as I dodged the dog shit
that was scattered outside the trailer door.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day I told Dow that I had witnessed a homeless man begging for
change on a freeway exit and asked her if it was legal for him to own a dog. She
grimly replied, &quot;Well, I gues–we can&#39;t tell them... Believe it or not, almost
every time you see people begging for money on the side of the road–they
<em>always</em> have a dog!&quot; It&#39;s a simple psychological trick, but these people weren&#39;t
harboring animals for change, they were doing it because this lady &quot;seen too
many documentaries about American farming and how the meat is made and all that
and I just want no part of it.&quot; Considering we live in a capitalist society, my
natural inclination would be to find a way to make more money to purchase higher
quality food–but hey, that&#39;s just me and this may be a more sensible solution: live
in a trailer with your husband and three children (there were two younger children
which were at their biological father&#39;s house) with no running water with a hose
running from your neighbor&#39;s house to keep the animals quenched so you don&#39;t have
to eat that nasty hormone-injected grocery store meat.</p>
<p>Dow asked Green Hair some questions about the baby goats to ensure they were
being taken care of then we walked over to the bird enclosure. Green Hair told
Dow that the three turkeys were being raised for future specific occasions, and
were appropriately named Thanksgiving, Christmas, and [their son&#39;s name]&#39;s Birthday.
Some of the ducks were raised for meat and others for eggs. The chickens were
raised for eggs also, but the children didn&#39;t eat the chicken eggs anymore because
the duck eggs were so delicious. I walked back up to the truck while Dow established
all of the animals were being taken care of and asked her questions about her
living arrangements. Green Hair informed her they had recently bought a house in
Fort Morgan and they were going to be closing on it at the end of the month (it
was the first week of August) and they also bought a truck which would get the
family there, pointing at a 2003-ish white Dodge Ram near the neighbor&#39;s house.
Dow and I later called bullshit. After a fairly long conversation about their
new living arrangements, Dow told her that they would be back later in the week
to see how the goats were doing and bid her a farewell while I climbed into the
truck.</p>
<h2>End of Day</h2><p>&quot;Do you need any of this, you didn&#39;t touch anything?&quot; Dow asked with a bottle of
hand sanitizer standing in the doorway of the truck. &quot;No I didn&#39;t,&quot; I laughed,
&quot;luckily. We might need to take you into quarantine.&quot; She said when she got
inside the trailer she tripped and grabbed the corner of one of the four beds
they had inside. She made a gagging vomit face as she told me that she felt like
she needed a shower and I asked her &quot;What did it smell like?&quot; &quot;Just... dirtyness&quot;
she said. We then drove to Evergreen to issue another barking dog warning while
Dow told me disgusting stories about hoarders (the TL;DR is: teachers and nurses
are typically hoarders, also, oddly, people who have lawn gnomes. And houses get
so bad that the animal control officers have to fully gown up to clean up dead cats
and feces.)</p>
