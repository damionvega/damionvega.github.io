          | You have a great idea with big plans that you want to share with the world,
          | all you need is a little capital to get it past a simple prototype mockup
          | and some people to get behind the idea and make it for you.
          br
          br
          | Well, I'm here to say that it's not as easy as it sounds,
          | and those people are humans; not 'things' for you to gamble
          | on your 'Facebook killer'. The road is much longer than
          | you'd expect and full of abrupt detours &amp; accidents. The only
          | map for your company is the one you create and it's not uncommon
          | to break down in the middle of the desert with zero water.

        p.md6.left
          | I've learned that you should only build a business around something
          | you truly believe in--as your product or service will become your
          | life--live and work on it every minute you're awake, hire people
          | smarter than you who you would enjoy working with, learn to take
          | rejection the right way, learn to love the chase, and how to calmly persevere.
          br

          | If you take all of this and add a bit of luck, you have a chance of
          | taking it from that mockup or static page to startup to an actual profit-earning
          | business.

        h2 The sixty mile hike
        p.bg.clearfix
          | My friend Scott and I had gone on a sixty mile hike back home after
          | he had gotten into an argument with his girlfriend during a camping
          | trip with her family. I started packing my bag with him and he asked,
          | "You're walking back with me?" I replied with a stern look, "Yeah--what
          | else am I going to do, hang out with your girlfriend and her family? Let's
          | get out of here."
          br
          br
          | This is a story for another time. The short version is: we walked and
          | talked about all of the dreams we wanted to achieve in our lives for
          | eight miles and a tow truck driver pulled over and asked "Where
          | you boys headed?" luckily, he was taking a load to Sacramento where
          | we lived at the time. We hopped in.
          br
          br
          | The discussion in the portion we actually did end up walking was a turning
          | point in both of our lives and we came to the conclusion that motorcycles
          | are fun and all, but we didn't want to build with our hands anymore,
          | but our minds. Everything starts with an idea.

      .md6.right
        h2 The big idea
        p.bg.clearfix
          | The concept was a platform where you would be able to trade apps with
          | others: if you had a $20 app you could trade straight across with another
          | person who had an app of the same value, if the person's app was
          | less valuable, you would be credited the difference for future trade.
          | In retrospect, we were planning the Napster for apps without knowing it.
          | Scott asked me "How are we going to do this?"
          br
          br
          | We didn't have the money to hire a developer to build it for us,
          | neither of us had CS degrees or any real programming experience, and
          | we didn't have friends in the industry to help us. So I replied with the
          | only option we really had at the time: "I can probably make it, I
          | have Dreamweaver on my computer." How na&iuml;ve.
          br
          br
          | I was kind of a computer nerd in my middle school to early high school
          | years when I wasn't on my skateboard. Playing Counter-Strike, installing
          | mods &amp; skins into their proper directories and playing around with my MySpace&nbsp;
          code img
          | &nbsp;tags and hex colors was easy enough, "I can figure it out"
          | I thought to myself. If you google image search&nbsp;
          code motorcycle wiring diagram
          | &nbsp;, this was what I was comparing it to at the time. Just another thing
          | I had no idea about to learn without a proper teacher.
          br
          br
          | During this time there wasn't the same programming education there
          | is today. I had a really hard time figuring out what you needed to even
          | build a static page, let alone a trading application.
          | After reading countless blogs and Stack Overflow answers, I was able
          | to produce landing pages in HTML &amp; CSS relatively easily with all
          | of the tricks I've learned. But how do we make these interactive?
          | JavaScript? Is that like this PHP thing? Oh it's Java, no? What's
          | a localhost? Command Line? You mean that black interface with
          | the green text Jason Bourne uses? You have to be some kind of genius
          | to use that though, don't you?

        p.bg.clearfix
          | After spending a year with my face attached to my computer screen, I eventually
          | learned all of these basic fundamentals to build both Scott and I websites as
          | well as our dream company website, a creative thinktank we called DNSD Global
          | Ventures. Under this name housed our army of ideas we talked about during the
          | course of the year: Map The Move, Tennup, AutoGenius, First Date Genius, and
          | Gifts of Treasure to name a few.
          br
          br
          | We had an ongoing joke, "Wanna drive to Silicon Valley? Right now?" Which
          | we figured was the only solution to get one of these ideas off the ground and
          | come to fruition (yep, we were one of
          em &nbsp;those guys
          | ). We came to an
          | agreement that if one of us said it again that we would pack our bikes into
          | the back of the truck and start driving. That day inevitably came not long thereafter.

        .bg.clearfix
          p I planned our trip itinerary from Denver through Salt Lake City, Reno
            | then Sacramento which consisted of:

          ul.checklist
            li 1,279 miles
            li one truck
            li two motorcycles
            li four bags of clothes
            li two pairs of sunglasses
            li one guitar
            li one welder
            li tools
            li not nearly enough money to cover the trip.

          p Perfect. This is what everyone does, right?

          p.tiny I found the answer to this later when I asked our friend Jake the
            | same question after we rode trash cans down a hill in San Francisco
            | with him. "No," he laughed, "no one does that."

          p
            | We drove through the night and the trip had begun. I had faith the truck would
            | make it--after all, it had more balls than the Broncos' locker room, could
            | take a side swipe from a smart car no problem, had no power steering
            | and a granny four on the floor. Add a little
            span.motorhead &nbsp;Mot&ouml;rhead
            | &nbsp;at full volume and you've got yourself a machine built for the
            | road (yes, none of these are deciding factors when embarking on a trip
            | half way across the country, but I had you going, didn't I?)

            br
            br
            | We eventually arrived to Salt Lake City where we were invited to stay
            | at Scott's ex-girlfriend's friend's place. Ironically,
            | this friend would slowly turn into my girlfriend sometime during the
            | trip. While we were exiting off of the highway I noticed the truck
            | lost some power, but we decided to fix it the next day and get some
            | much needed sleep.

        p.md6.left
          | After some quick tinkering the next day, we were on our way west again.
          | We got on the highway and drove approximately thirty miles, then suddenly, smoke
          | came barreling out of the hood. From a distance it probably looked like a truck on
          | fire with two motocycles driving it. This couldn't be good. We let the smoke settle
          | and I tried starting it. Nothing. Turned the key again with a couple taps of the gas.
          | Nothing. The first thing we noticed after checking the levels was we were dangerously
          | low on oil and the coolant was nonexistant.
          br
          br
          | The only oil we had was in one of our bikes and we had to put it in
          | the truck. We jerry-rigged a 'solution' for the coolant with two permanent
          | markers blocking the coolant line to the reservoir and to go one direction:
          | into the motor. We decided to try to get back to a little gas station
          | we stopped at ten miles back to get some oil and find a better fix for the coolant.
          br
          br
          | After what seemed like hours, the truck still wasn't starting and
          | there was really only one option: Dreamweaver. Just kidding, there was
          | a small decline behind us and I said, "If we push the truck down
          | that way, I can jump in and try to start it by popping the clutch."
          | This was a long shot, we would be lucky to get the truck going fifteen
          | miles per hour down this dinky little downgrade and were going to be
          | in an even worse situation if it didn't work considering we wouldn't
          | be visible from the highway anymore, but we had to try.

        p.md6.left
          | We rolled the truck back, turned it around and looked at each other. We took a
          | deep breath, gave each other a nod and began pushing the big hunk of metal down the
          | slope like a pair of ameteur bobsledders at their first Olympic Games
          | tryout. I jumped in and pushed the clutch in and with my lips tucked
          | into my mouth and brows pushed tight, I snapped the clutch and slammed
          | the gas. Nothing. "SHIT!" I exclaimed, "Keep pushing!" I pushed the
          | clutch again and spoke with the truck, "C'mon LaFonda, you can do it."
          | We were almost to the bottom of the downgrade, it was now or never. I
          | popped the clutch and slammed the gas again and this time the motor
          | roared! Scott jumped in the window and we yelled with excitement with
          | our fists out the windows, "YEEEAAHHHHHHHH FUCK YEAH!!!!"
          br
          br
          | In my state of superhuman euphoria, I had a Lieutenant Dan moment and
          | screamed at the sky while seeing red, "IS THAT ALL YOU'VE GOT?!" We
          | were super hyped and continued down this windy dirt road hoping that
          | it eventually hooked back to the highway. It did and we broke down five
          | miles later on the highway. Either that wasn't all 'he' had, or that
          | oil from the bike didn't last very long.

            | night. After getting the OK, we somehow got back to their house and one night turned
            | into a week and a half and a pissed off roomate- we had to get out of there and
            | tried to get to Reno four separate times, but the truck was not cooperating.

          p
            | We later found out that the guy who sold us the truck had the wrong radiator in the
            | truck, it was meant for a v6, not a v8 and thus, not cooling the motor
            | properly and burning oil excessively. We decided to sell everything

          | We landed in San Jose and took a shuttle to the CalTran where we ran

          | people to talk to." We later booked a stay at a 'Hacker Mansion'
          | via Airbnb--this should be awesome. We envisioned a house with whiteboards for walls
